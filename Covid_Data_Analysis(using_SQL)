These are the SQL queries used to obtained the relevant information I needed to produce the 
following Tableau dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leandro.falero/viz/CovidDataAnalysis_16339003219740/Dashboard1

SELECT 
    location,
    date,
    population,
    total_cases,
    new_cases,
    total_deaths
FROM
    covid_deaths
WHERE
    continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1 , 2;

-- total cases VS total deaths
-- shows estimate of your chances of dying of covid

SELECT 
    location,
    date,
    population,
    total_cases,
    total_deaths,
    (total_deaths / total_cases) * 100 AS death_ratio
FROM
    covid_deaths
WHERE
    location LIKE ('%states%')
ORDER BY 1 , 2;



-- total cases vs population
-- shows what percentaje of population has covid

SELECT 
    location,
    date,
    population,
    total_cases,
    total_deaths,
    (total_cases / population) * 100 AS infected_pop_ratio
FROM
    covid_deaths
WHERE
    location LIKE ('%states%')
ORDER BY 1 , 2;



-- countries with highest infection rate compared to population

SELECT 
    location,
    population,
    MAX(total_cases) AS highestInfectionCount,
    total_deaths,
    MAX((total_cases / population)) * 100 AS infected_pop_ratio
FROM
    covid_deaths
WHERE
    continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location , population
ORDER BY 5 DESC;

-- Countries with Highest Death Count per Population

Select Location, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as SIGNED integer)) as TotalDeathCount
From covid_deaths
Where continent is not null 
Group by Location
order by TotalDeathCount desc;


-- Showing contintents with the highest death count per population

Select continent, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as SIGNED integer)) as TotalDeathCount
From covid_deaths
Where continent is not null 
Group by continent
order by TotalDeathCount desc;
