## Explotarory Data Analysis (EDA)

For this analysis I will be using the starwars dataset which is
part of the Dplyr package. 

First I will load the packages we will need.

library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(inspectdf)
library(DataExplorer)

I will now inspect the dataset to become familiar with it
using different functions.

head(starwars)
tail(starwars)
glimpse(starwars)
inspect_mem(starwars) %>% show_plot()

Check for missing values

inspect_na(starwars) 

"birth_year" has 44 missing values, which represents %50.6 of its total

I will now use the function inspect_types() to see how the different 
numeric and character variables are distributed.

inspect_types(starwars)  %>% show_plot()

Plot shows that we have 3 lists, 2 numeric, 1 integer, and 8 
character variables.


Checking unique values for some categorical variables

unique(starwars$hair_color) # There are 13 unique values
unique(starwars$skin_color) # There are 31 unique skin colors


Check for the distribution of all the numeric variables     

inspect_num(starwars) %>% show_plot() # We see that Height is normally distributed


Inspect the distribuition of categorical variables   

inspect_cat(starwars) %>% show_plot()


I will now inspect the correlation coefficients to see 
how the variables may relate to one another

plot_correlation(na.omit(starwars), maxcat = 5L)

# I found correlation for "mass" and "height"
# Strong correlation for "gender" and "sex" 
# Correlation for "mass" and "gender"
